Hello, lets try to organize this repository in parts.

# General Information

1. Every TryHackMe(THM) room there will be a \*.md file to represent the notes about it
2. Here in the main README.md file if will map this learning structure. For example the Complete Beginner will point to the files to each room inside. This way I will avoid having double files and having to update twice.
